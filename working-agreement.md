# Working Agreement

## Ensemble Style

We'll follow typical ensemble rules, embracing the communication method from strong-style pairing.

### Roles
- Navigator

  The Navigator communicates requests to the Typist at the highest-level the current Typist can understand. Intent, location, and detail.
  - Yes and Rule: Pick up from where the previous navigator left off. We want to continue on the same path until we agree it can't work or that we can make it work.

- Typist

  Typist takes direction from only the Navigator and turns the request into code. Listen to the navigator and the ensemble.
  No decisions at the keyboard.

- Ensemblist

  The Ensemblist contributes thoughts/idea, asks questions, performs research, and just tries to help the work proceed
  as smoothly as possible.

### Ground Rules

- Kindness, Consideration, and Respect
- Typing is not the bottleneck
- Ask questions if you don't know what's going on
